# Libft - My C Function Library

Introduction
Lib2code is a library of C functions, created from my libft that contains a collection of common utilities that are frequently used in software development and that will accompany me throughout the course 42, so it will be constantly expanded. This library includes functions for string manipulation, type conversions, memory management, and more. The main idea behind Lib2code is to provide a robust and optimized toolset that can be reused across multiple projects, making development easier and faster.

### Features:
#### Conversions and Checks:
ft_atoi.c: Converts a character string to an integer.
ft_atoll.c: Converts a character string into a long long number.
ft_isalnum.c: Checks if a character is alphanumeric.
ft_isalpha.c: Checks if a character is a letter.
ft_isascii.c: Checks if a character belongs to the ASCII set.
ft_isdigit.c: Checks if a character is a digit.
ft_ishexdigit.c: Checks if a character is a hexadecimal digit.
ft_isprint.c: Checks if a character is printable.
ft_isspace.c: Checks if a character is whitespace.
ft_tolower.c: Converts a character to lowercase.
ft_toupper.c: Converts a character to uppercase.

#### String Manipulation
ft_strlen.c: Calculates the length of a string.
ft_strdup.c: Duplicate a string.
ft_strchr.c: Finds the first occurrence of a character in a string.
ft_strrchr.c: Finds the last occurrence of a character in a string.
ft_strncmp.c: Compares two strings up to n characters.
ft_strnstr.c: Finds a substring in a string, up to n characters.
ft_strlcpy.c: Copies one string into another, ensuring null termination.
ft_strlcat.c: Concatenates one string to another, ensuring null termination.
ft_strjoin.c: Concatenates two strings into a new string.
ft_strtrim.c: Trims specific characters from the start and end of a string.
ft_substr.c: Extracts a substring from a string.
ft_split.c: Splits a string into an array of strings using a delimiter.
ft_strmapi.c: Applies a function to each character in a string, creating a new string.
ft_striteri.c: Applies a function to each character in a string.

#### Memory Management:
ft_calloc.c: Allocates memory for an array and initializes it to zero.
ft_memset.c: Fills a memory block with a specific value.
ft_bzero.c: Sets a block of memory to zero.
ft_memcpy.c: Copy one block of memory to another.
ft_memmove.c: Move one memory block to another.
ft_memchr.c: Searches a character in a block of memory.
ft_memcmp.c: Compares two blocks of memory.

#### Entrance exit:
ft_putchar_fd.c: Write a character to a descriptor file.
ft_putstr_fd.c: Write a string to a descriptor file.
ft_putendl_fd.c: Writes a string with a newline to a descriptor file.
ft_putnbr_fd.c: Write a number to a descriptor file.
Linked Lists (Bonus)
ft_lstnew_bonus.c: Create a new linked list node.
ft_lstadd_front_bonus.c: Adds a node to the start of a linked list.
ft_lstsize_bonus.c: Calculates the size of a linked list.
ft_lstlast_bonus.c: Returns the last node of a linked list.
ft_lstadd_back_bonus.c: Adds a node to the end of a linked list.
ft_lstdelone_bonus.c: Removes a node from a linked list.
ft_lstclear_bonus.c: Removes and frees all nodes from a linked list.
ft_lstiter_bonus.c: Iterates over each node of a list, applying a function.
ft_lstmap_bonus.c: Applies a function to each node in a list and creates a new list.

#### Extra Utilities: 
ft_printf.c: Implementation of the printf function for output formatting.
ft_string.c: Advanced string manipulation.
ft_unsigned.c: Handling unsigned integers.
ft_number.c: Number manipulation and conversion.
ft_hexadecimals.c: Specific functions for hexadecimal numbers.
ft_char.c: Character-specific functions.
ft_pointers.c: Pointer manipulation.
display_error.c: Functions to display errors.
free_2d.c: Freeing memory for 2D arrays.
ft_sqrt.c: Calculates the square root of a number.
checkD_bf.c: Check functions.
ins_sort.c: Implementation of sorting algorithms.
ft_index.c: Indexing functions.
ft_addFS.c: Additional string manipulation functions.
ft_char2bin.c: Converting characters to binary.
ft_string2bin.c: Converting strings to binary.
ft_bin2ascii.c: Binary to ASCII conversion.

# Extra

The expansion and use of this library is essential throughout the 42 course, the design of the common core makes previous projects the basis of the following ones, which is why this will be my main "toolbox" during that period.
